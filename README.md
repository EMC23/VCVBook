The ABC plugin contains all modules described in the book.

All material is released under a GPLv3 license, except when differently stated.

Please note: these examples are for didactical purposes only. They are not necessarily meant to be efficient or bug-less. The book often provides a discussion on alternative ways to implement things, with pros and cons. Do not learn by Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V! 
Please note: many of my modules will have text labels written in code, not embedded as a path in the SVG file. This made the development of graphics quicker and more repeatable for me. This is not the best way for production, as explained in the book. Follow the Rack guidelines to prepare your SVG file and panel widgets.
